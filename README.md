File summary
- Purpose: Computes and prints the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two input strings and its length using dynamic programming and backpointers.
- Language: Java
- Entry point: public class Lcs with main method reading two tokens from stdin.

How it works (brief)
- Builds an (m+1) x (n+1) table of cells that store:
  - v: length of LCS for prefixes up to that cell
  - d: direction/backpointer ('d' = diagonal / match, 'u' = up, 's' = left)
- Fills the table row by row: when characters match, take diagonal+1; otherwise take the larger of up or left and record direction.
- Recursively follows backpointers from cost[m][n] to print the LCS in the correct order.
- Finally prints the LCS and its length.

Known issues / bugs to fix
- The source defines class C but uses D[][] cost and new D() — mismatch (compile error). Fix by renaming C to D or change D to C.
- Minor typos in output text ("LENGHT" → "LENGTH").
- Scanner.next() reads a token (no spaces). If you want full lines use Scanner.nextLine().
- Direction character 's' is used for left; consider using 'l' for clarity.
- Class and method naming: consider following Java conventions (class names start with uppercase, methods camelCase).
- Current implementation stores the whole table (O(m*n) memory). If you only need the length, memory can be reduced to O(min(m,n)).

Time & space complexity
- Time: O(m * n) where m = length of string a, n = length of string b.
- Space: O(m * n) for the full DP table and backpointers. Can be reduced to O(min(m,n)) if only the length is required (but not the sequence reconstruction).

Usage / example
- Compile: javac Lcs.java
- Run: java Lcs
- Example interactive run:
  - Input:
    ENTER STRING 1: AGGTAB
    ENTER STRING 2: GXTXAYB
  - Output:
    LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE IS: 
    GTAB
    LENGHT OF THE LCS IS: 4

Suggested small corrections (summary)
- Rename class C → D (or change all D references to C).
- Fix printed messages spelling.
- Consider handling full lines with nextLine() if inputs may contain spaces.
- Optionally change direction markers to clearer names and add comments.
- Add unit tests or example runs in a README.

If you want, I can:
- Provide a corrected version of the file (compilable).
- Produce detailed inline comments or a README.md content for the repo. Which would you prefer?
